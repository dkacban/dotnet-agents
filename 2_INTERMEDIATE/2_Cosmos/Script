1. Concrete Experience
- How to scale our app? 
  + We use Memory Storage - what may happen when we scale?

2. Reflective Observation (Drawing - simulation)
  + Imagine we run 2 instances on the server 
  + message 1 hits instance 1
  + message 2 hits instance 2
  + what happens to converation context? (lost)

3. Abstract Conceptualization
  + Instead of using Memory storage => CosmosDB
  + Benefits: our conversation is on the server shared among instances

4. Active Experimenting
- Exercise: Create your own Cosmos instance and use in your app
