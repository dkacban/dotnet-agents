1. Concrete Experience
- Simulation: Let's run our Web API and call with Postman


2. Reflective Observation
- What are limitations of our app?
  + expose via Teams, SMS, Whatsapp, or Twilio (channels)
  + no built-in conversation logging (custom appinsight, custom DB)

3. Abstract Conceptualization
- Agents 365 help in integrations like Teams, web channel, SMS
- direct line - call agent from any application
- Integration with Semanic Kernel
- Track converation with CosmosDB

4. Active Experimenting
- Exercise
